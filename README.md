# Unsupervised Machine Learning

A brief intro on how to use unsupervised learning techniques to improve machine learning solutions with supervised learning.

# Environment

We use `python` version  `3.6.0`. 
The dependencies can be installed using the `requirements.txt` including `xgboost version 0.9` and `lightgbm version 2.3.1`.
However, for the `lightgbm` to be imported without errors, make sure to have run `brew install libomp`. Here is more details on [lightgbm](https://pypi.org/project/lightgbm/).
